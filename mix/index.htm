Mutliculturalism is monoculturalism. For guess what; you can't have all cultures at once. Races blend, and thus you lose culture.</P>

Behold, what happened to the Mesoamericans? Do they still have their cultures? their languages? their traditions? No, it's all gone. Only the memory thereof remains. Only Latin American nations with large Mesoamerican populations have kept their culture. Black people are next... if they are left prey to miscegenation.

God created the races, and He created them seperate. Why would God create the races, all diverse and beautiful, for them to turn into an amalgam? He did not. Miscegenation destroys His beautiful works. It is as if we turned all the colors, the green of the grass, the blue of the sky, etc. and made it all brown. Is that what God intended for? No, God created all the colors, each unique and beautiful.
<HR><P>

Have simpathy for a moment. Imagine you created an artwork, laying out the different colors, each with their aspects and orginality. You instruct the colors not to mix (Ezra 10:10, Nehemiah 13:27) that they may remain beautiful. However, they do not listen to you, their creator, instead listening to false teachers among them. How would you feel? Exactly, it would provoke your wrath, and you wrath would burn against them unless they cease and repent. Race-mixing is evil.

<PRE><FONT SIZE=4><B>GOD'S BEAUTY DESTROYED BY MISCEGENATION
A Poem By Iesus Church

Behold, the roses had sex with the grass,
And the sunshine with the shadows,
The flowers with the grass,
And the grass with the dirt.

They mixed and mixed
Until there were no more types of plants but one.

There were no more shades.
There were no more flower colors.
It all turned into brown,
God's Beauty destroyed.
</B></FONT></PRE><P>

<FONT SIZE=5 FACE="serif"><B>A</B></FONT>nd indeed, the effect of miscegenation is not much unlike that described above. There are roses and tulips and bluebonnets and lilies among us. I am a bluebonnet. Obama is a rose. You may be a sunflower or an orchid. Regardless, you are beautiful and unique, and your kind deserves to live. To believe in miscegenation is to hate diversity, to put all races in the Machine to be blended with blades of iron.
