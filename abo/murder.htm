The Bible is clear on the issue: abortion is murder. We see it all the way going back to the first chapter of Genesis when God tells mankind to "Be fruitful, and multiply"

(<A HREF="javascript:void(0)" ONCLICK="alert(this.title)" TITLE='"And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth."'>Genesis 1:28)</A>

We then see it again in Exodus when God gives the sixth of the ten commandments and says "Thou shalt not kill." (Exodus 20:13). No one should ever justify abortion. If doing so they justify cold-blooded murder of the worst kind.<P>

This straying from God and perverting of God's word has led to the death of <A HREF=""></A> people since Roe v. Wade.
