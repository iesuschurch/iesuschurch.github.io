<B><FONT SIZE=6>O</FONT></B>n April 20th we commemorate the German leader who brought the <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weimar_Republic">Weimar Republic</A> out of an economic depression, hyperinflation, <A HREF="https://dailystormer.in/soul-brotha-says-weimar-republic-was-the-greatest-democracy-ever" REL="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">sexual degeneracy</A> <A HREF="http://stormer5v52vjsw66jmds7ndeecudq444woadhzr2plxlaayexnh6eqd.onion/soul-brotha-says-weimar-republic-was-the-greatest-democracy-ever" REL="external nofollow noopener noreferrer"><FONT COLOR="purple">[tor]</FONT></A>, and a generally lost nation. He gave them something they hadn't had since the German Empire - hope. He brought life to their dead eyes, and inspired a nation to again achieve greatness overcoming the dire circumstances. Therefore on April 20th we celebrate the both national and global leader, Adolf Hitler.<P>

As well as a day to commemorate Hitler, April 20th is a day of self-improvement and reflexion. It is a time to remember our bigger-than-life holy goals and work to achieve them, a time to refresh the mind from the perverting, sex-saturated, nihilistic society we live in and focus on becoming the best version of ourselves. It is a day in which we learn, grow, and become stronger. <!--For further information read <A HREF="celebwhy.htm">why you should celebrate Hitler's birthday.</A>--> Without further adue, let's get into the guide.

<H2>Sing <A HREF="bday.htm">Happy Birthday in German</A></H2>

<IMG SRC="bday.gif" WIDTH=168 HEIGTH=108 ALT="Hitler Saluting" ALIGN="right"><P>

You can sing the American song <A HREF="bday.htm">Happy Birthday</A> in German, but better yet, you can sing the <EM>traditional</EM> German song <A HREF="leben.mp3">Hoch Soll Er Leben</A>. Here is a <A HREF="bday.htm">guide</A> on how to sing Happy Birthday in German, couresty of <A HREF="../index.htm">Iesus Church</A>.




<H2>Do Not Eat Meat</H2><P>

Believe it or not, <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler_and_vegetarianism">Hitler was a vegetarian.</A> There is even evidence of this in his teeth (although he would make exceptions). To commemorate Hitler and his legacy, do not eat meat on his birthday (April 20th). Moreover, be kind to animals. Pet your dog, especially if it's a German Shepherd, for Hitler himself was an animal lover.<P>

<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horst-Wessel-Lied">Horst Wessel-Lied</A> (German for <I>Horst Wessel's Song</I>) is a song written by <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horst_Wessel">Horst Wessel</A>, a German martyr who was shot by a communist when the Nationalist Socialist Party was starting to rise to power. <A HREF="https://en.wikipdia.org/wiki/Joseph_Goebbels">Joseph Goebbels</A> then published the song and lyrics in his newspaper, <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Der_Angriff" TITLE="The Attack"><I>Der Angriff</I></A>. The song later became the co-national anthem of Germany, the national anthem being <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutschlandlied">Deutschlandlied</A> (whose lyrics or notes you can also learn for April 20th). The song is emblematic of Nazi Germany and very nice. So, instead of singing Hitler happy birthday (which I suppose you could), you should sing him Horst Wessel-Lied. Also, the <A HREF="#music">music-button above</A> plays Horst Wessel Lied when clicked.

<H2>Goose Step</H2>

Have a fun time practicing your <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goose_step">goose step</A> for Hitler's birthday. The goose step was the marching style used by Nazi Germany until the ladder years of WWII when they had more pressing matters. It is a marching style wherein you have to kick your leg up without bending it. Do something like <A HREF="https://youtu.be/QT56Xj0UZos">this guy</A>.</P>

<H2>Lift and Cold Showers</H2><P>

Go lift and take a cold shower, preferrably in the morning. Lift hard - you should be sore on April 21st - and take the cold shower unhesitantly. Hitler Youth used to go into the freezing-cold German rivers as punishment from their squad leader; that I remember reading. And taking cold showers is in memory thereof. It will remind of those soldiers who trained and fought hard to save their nation from becoming the <A HREF="https://dailystormer.in/soul-brotha-says-weimar-republic-was-the-greatest-democracy-ever" REL="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">cesspool of humanity</A> <A HREF="http://stormer5v52vjsw66jmds7ndeecudq444woadhzr2plxlaayexnh6eqd.onion/soul-brotha-says-weimar-republic-was-the-greatest-democracy-ever" REL="external nofollow noopener noreferrer"><FONT COLOR="purple">[tor]</FONT></A> it once was - and <A HREF="https://metro.co.uk/2017/06/30/gay-marriage-has-been-legalised-in-germany-6745389/" TITLE="Look at the images">has become</A>.

<H2>Learn About Hitler & Natsoc</H2>

Do you know about <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horst_Wessel">Horst Wessel</A>, the natsoc martyr and songwriter? Do you know about <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Goebbels">Joseph Goebbels</A>, the propaganda chief? Did you know Hitler used to be a heavy smoker but then quit altogether? What about the <A HREF="https://dailystormer.in/soul-brotha-says-weimar-republic-was-the-greatest-democracy-ever" REL="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">Weimar Republic</A> <A HREF="http://stormer5v52vjsw66jmds7ndeecudq444woadhzr2plxlaayexnh6eqd.onion/soul-brotha-says-weimar-republic-was-the-greatest-democracy-ever" REL="external nofollow noopener noreferrer"><FONT COLOR="purple">[tor]</FONT></A> and its depravities? There is plenty of history to learn, wherefrom you can draw inspiration.</P>

<H2>General Self-Improvement</H2><P>

Become a better version of yourself. Become a superhuman, a real member of the Aryan Master Race. Work out, fast, pray, take challenges, take risks, groom, eat healthily, etc. Do not <EM>(ever)</EM> watch <A HREF="../index.htm#p0rn">porn</A> and do not <A HREF="https://youtu.be/MekI4zIJgC0" TITLE="IceCold JT!">masturbate</A>. If you want to accomplish anything, you have to become stronger, otherwise you won't be able to accomplish anything. Become the man younger you would stand in awe of. Most men are pathetic when compared to SS officers. Do not let that be yo. Do not be a degenerate, <A HREF="../evo/domestication.htm">domesticated</A> so-called man. Be a man your ancestors could be proud of. If you want to bring about change, you must be strong both physically (therefore work out), spiritually (therefore pray and read the Bible), and psychologically (therefore take cold showers). Also, be smart and do some brain-straining activities such as puzzles or logistic tasks. Plan a trip or something. Also, reading is good for you; read all of <A HREF="../index.htm">Iesus Church</A>'s articles.

<H2>Do Not Smoke</H2>

<IMG SRC="nosmoke.gif" WIDTH=175 HEIGHT=143 HSPACE=5 ALT="Nicht er sie.... sie fri&szlig;t ihn!" TITLE="He does not devour it... it devours him!" ALIGN="left"><P>

Hitler was <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany#Health">against smoking</A>. He offered a gold watch to close associates who would quit smoking. His leadership ran the largest anti-smoking campaign in the world during his time<SUP><A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-tobacco_movement_in_Nazi_Germany">[1]</A></SUP>, funding German researchers to do research which would eventually discover the link between smoking and lung cancer. Hitler truly was ahead of his time - and right all along!</P><P>

If you consider yourself unable to stop smoking, consider, you guessed it, Hitler. He used to be a heavy smoker back in his youth, smoking 25 to 40 cigarettes daily, but then he quit and advocated for others to do the same. <SUP><A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler#Health">[2]</A></SUP>. Thus he saved his lungs from a lot of damage as well as those of others. If F&uuml;hrer can do it, so can you.

<H2>Learn German</H2><P>

Hitler said that if he had won, everyone in Europe would speak German. Behold

So try learning some German. Maybe learn both the lyrics and meaning of <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutschlandlied">Deutschlandlied</A>.


<H2>Tell Others</H2><P>

Tell others about Hitler's birthday. To bring Hitler up, I reccomend saying</P>
