<FONT SIZE=5><B>T</B></FONT>he Bible is our compass. If we forget it or proudly forsake it believing we don't need it, we will lose our way from treasures to destruction. We may start off in the correct path, but when storms come and lead us astray, we will not know where to turn, for we have forgotten God, our compass. Therefore we will not reach treasure, but rather the winds (Satan) will hurl us against the rocks and kill us.</P>

Therefore I warn all my brothers: hold fast unto the Word of God, so that even when storms come, you will get through them, and you will not go astray but rather go in the right path. Without God we are lost. We are sheep without a shepherd.

<H2>The Evidence</H2><P>

The evidence that we need God is manifest. We have strayed so far from God. We have forgotten God for so long. Therefore we have the lost society we have today. We have lost our way and have been led astray by the winds into:</P>

We need Jesus Christ. Ye West's mother used to say only Jesus can save us. And indeed, only Jesus, our compass, can lead us north, away from the rocky hills of death.

Is not the Word of God always right? Verily, for it has proven true always, and it has consistently exposed <A HREF="#evils" ONCLICK="outline()">evils</A>, for God is the author thereof. For the Bible is a good compass that always points north, and since antiquity is has pointed north. Yet many man have forsaken it and gone elsewhere, but this has been their demise. Many men have seen where north is, yet they have turned the directions of their wicked hearts south. I exhort thee, my brother, that thou would not be so foolish, but rather that thou would hearken unto God and turn north unto many treasures.</P>
