<I><STRONG>Thesis: Jesus Christ saves us <U>not only</U> from Hell after death; He saves us from Hell on earth. For God instills morality upon men, and He teaches against many evils whereby men would otherwise be lead astray and bring upon a demonic society, which is what we have today.</STRONG></I>

Christ is the way to morality. We need God, for otherwise we are lost. The Bible is the ultimate <A HREF="../trth/compass.htm">moral compass</A>, and without it mankind loses his way and is lost. "I thought on my ways, and turned my feet unto thy testimonies." (Psalms 119:59) That we have forgotten God is the reason why our society is suffering the many evils it undergoes (yet the evil promote) such as child sacrifice <A HREF="../abo/murder.htm">(abortion)</A>, child mutilation (trannies) <A HREF="../gay/index.htm">sodomy</A> (putting your tongue into another's poop), <A HREF="../wom/rights.htm">feminism</A> (the destruction of the family and thus society), etc.</P>

Therefore it is my exhortation that thou would turn unto Christ, for through Him shalt thou be saved, and all the nations shall find peace. For it is God who brings upon morality. And it is God that protects us from abomination.<P>

For his word is like an anchor for our boat, for it protecteth us from crashing against mountains, and it endureth forever. Psalms 119:160
