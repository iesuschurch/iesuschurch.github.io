esus often said throughout His ministry that we would be persecuted for His sake, that men will hate them and even kill them for righteousness' sake

<A HREF="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/k/kjv/kjv-idx?type=citation&book=2+Corinthians&chapno=4&startverse=8"
   TITLE="We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair;"
   ONCLICK="alert(this.title);return false;">2 Corinthians 4:8</A>,
<A HREF="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/k/kjv/kjv-idx?type=citation&book=Matthew&chapno=8&startverse=20"
   TITLE="And Jesus saith unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head."

Hering that in church, undoubtedly some have wondered, What persecution? For indeed, we sit in our pews without need for discretion. We wear crucifixes and receive no objection. There are Christians all around us, and in no wise are we persecuted. So, then, was Jesus' prophecy false? Is this Jesus' Unfulfilled Prophecy?<P CLASS="i">

In no wise! As Christians we know the Word of God is inerrant, and that the teachings of Jesus Christ are true. Therefore we realize this: we are doing something wrong. Christians are doing something wrong. How come we are not being persecuted? If we are followers of Christ, why do we have a place to lay our heads?<P CLASS="i">

Behold, the answer is this: we should not be Christians. I am not a Christian. We should be followers of Christ. Christians have a place to lay their heads. Christians are fat and wealthy. Christians are indolent and vapid; they dare not wander past their comfortable ventillated churches, to stand up from their cushioned pews. These are the Christians which Christ knoweth not

(<A HREF="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/k/kjv/kjv-idx?type=citation&book=Matthew&chapno=25&startverse=12"
    TITLE="But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not."

   TITLE="When once the master of the house is risen up, and hath shut to the door, and ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open unto us; and he shall answer and say unto you, I know you not whence ye are:"
   ONCLICK="alert(this.title);return false;">Luke 13:25</A>).

Rather, the <A HREF="https://www.bitchute.com/channel/V2csMuLU2Fef/" REL="nofollow noreferrer">Follower of Christ</A> is <A HREF="https://soapboxie.com/misc/Reasons-Why-People-Hate-Kanye-West">hated</A>. The follower of Christ has <A HREF="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/kanye-west-and-others-drop-off-forbes-billionaires-list/ar-AA19ybyR">no where to lay his head</A>. The follower of Christ takes action

    TITLE="And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves," ONCLICK="alert(this.title);return false;">Matthew 21:12</A>). And the follower of Christ rises up against the evildoers

(<A HREF="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/k/kjv/kjv-idx?type=citation&book=Psalms&chapno=94&startverse=16"
    TITLE="Who will rise up for me against the evildoers? or who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?"
    ONCLICK="alert(this.title);return false;">Psalms 94:16</A>).<P CLASS="i">

Now, what is this I am saying in <A HREF="https://cdn.memegenerator.es/imagenes/memes/full/2/8/2088387.jpg">practical terms</A>? Come with me, and let us take a stance against homosexuality

(<A HREF="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/k/kjv/kjv-idx?type=citation&book=Leviticus&chapno=18&startverse=22"
    TITLE="Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination."
    ONCLICK="alert(this.title);return false;">Leviticus 18:22</A>). Let us stand against the rosary

(<A HREF="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/k/kjv/kjv-idx?type=citation&book=Matthew&chapno=6&startverse=7"
    TITLE="But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking."
    ONCLICK="alert(this.title);return false;">Matthew 6:7</A>).

Let us stand against feminism

(<A HREF="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/k/kjv/kjv-idx?type=citation&book=1+Timothy&chapno=2&startverse=12"
    TITLE="But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence."
    ONCLICK="alert(this.title);return false;">1 Timothy 2:12</A>).

Let us stand against miscegenation

(<A HREF="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/k/kjv/kjv-idx?type=citation&book=Ezra&chapno=10&startverse=10"
    TITLE="And Ezra the priest stood up, and said unto them, Ye have transgressed, and have taken strange wives, to increase the trespass of Israel."
    ONCLICK="alert(this.title);return false;">Ezra 10:10</A>,
<A HREF="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/k/kjv/kjv-idx?type=citation&book=Nehemiah&chapno=13&startverse=27"
   TITLE="Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil, to transgress against our God in marrying strange wives?"
   ONCLICK="alert(this.title);return false;">Nehemiah 13:27</A>,
<A HREF="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/k/kjv/kjv-idx?type=citation&book=1+Esdras&chapno=9&startverse=7"
   TITLE="So Esdras arose up, and said unto them, Ye have transgressed the law in marrying strange wives, thereby to increase the sins of Israel."
   ONCLICK="alert(this.title);return false;">1 Esdras 9:7</A>).

The world will hate us therefore, but God will reward us. This is what Jesus prophecized about: that the world would persecute us for His sake. They will kill us thinking we are hateful, but this is what Jesus prophecized about

    ONCLICK="alert(this.title);return false;">John 16:2</A>).

Thus you will forget what it is to be a Christian, and will understand what it is to be a follower of Christ and the true plight thereof. Get off your pews, we have work to do. Please share this article with all your friends.</P>
