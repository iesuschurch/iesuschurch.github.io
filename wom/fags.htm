Feminism turns men into faggots because</P>

<DL><DL>
<DT><A HREF="../p0rn/index.htm">Pornography!</A></DT>
<DD>This is top of the list of a reason. Pornography is the
<A HREF="../p0rn/children.htm">cartridge and the bullet.</A>
It is <A HREF="../p0rn/kidnapped.htm">gun and the gunman.</A>
It is the... well, <A HREF="../p0rn/index.htm">you get it.</A>
And it would not be possible without, yes, you guessed it,
<A HREF="../p0rn/fall.jpg">women!</A> And no, I am not
thanking them, I am <A HREF="../p0rn/abominable.htm"
TITLE="preaching against porn">preaching against it.</A>
Behold, <A HREF="../p0rn/stop.htm">pornography is a drug.</A> Orgasms literally create a response in the brain
comparable to heroin. (I couldn't find the link I wanted. You
can just <A HREF="https://duckduckgo.com">look it up</A>,
though.)
</DD>
<DT>Birth Control Pills</DT>
<DD>Feminism is responsible for all sorts of health woes, such
as, foremost, birth-control pills. These, when peed out by
women, go into the water supply, and we, men, end up drinking
it, and it poisons us with estrogen and we become more
effeminate.</DD>
<DT>Women Bosses</DT>
<DD>D'you know what's the worst part about having a job? Being
told what to do by an old, angry, hag, witch woman. This is an
outrage against nature. By nature, we are supposed to seize
that woman and tell her to shut the f*ck up because we
freaking can - social darwinism, mother trucker. But, woefully,
we cannot without getting fired or worse. This makes it so men
have to dimish their inner beast into a kitten; a pussy, that
is.</DD>
<DT>Poisonous Food</DT>
<DD>"What's for lunch?"<BR>
"I don't f-ing know, you lazy dog. Go buy McDonalds or some
sheet. I'm not your f-ing maid." barked back the doggess in a
deep voice.<BR>
And so, they bought McDonalds. It poisons them. They no longer
ate healthy food at home, but instead ate hamburgers. Bro, the
food from McDonalds is all frozen from the factories. Who
knows how many chemicals they put in them! And bad diets
contribute to a loss of testosterone and therefore manliness
which creates faggots.

       TITLE="Disclaimer: I'm not Catholic."
       ONCLICK="alert(this.title);">Delayed Manhood</A></DT>
<DD>Society tells women to whore around their entire youth,
and then when they are old and used-up like the public toilets,
they can get married. So what about the men? They are jacking
off to <A HREF="../p0rn/index.htm">pornography</A> for thirty
years and do nothing but be children for thirty years. They
don't have children and become men thereby. Take, for example,
the men in the <A HREF="fags.jpg">image above</A>. They don't
have children. I doubt they could even have children.

There's not time for a proper conclusion. I have to write
