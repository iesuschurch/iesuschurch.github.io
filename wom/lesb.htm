Let's not waste time. I won't event waste my time with color.
Let's get straight to the message. The message is this: I know
it sounds kind of wacky, but I have thought it through, and it
is true; feminism turns women into lesbians. Why? Feminism
tells women to be independent. But what happens when a woman
starts carrying around bricks and fixing ACs and fixing cars
and chopping down trees? Not only will she completely suck at
all of this, she will lose her high-pitched voice. She
will lose her delicacy and ladyness. She will even lose her
menstruations. Eventually, she will become this:</P><P>

^ That's what single moms turn into. Necessity forces them to
become that. It is like black women who came to behave like
men because they grew up without their fathers. We are all
victims of feminism. The women who bought into feminism are
like Eve in the garden who bit of the fruit and messed it up
for everyone.</P><P>

Think of Ms. Trunchbull from <I>Matilda</I>. She has no
husband. She is a proud feminist. Now think of Ms. Honey. She
is a sweet wife as intendeth the Lord. (Now, yes, I know they
are both single, but if Ms. Honey doesn't get married soon,
she will quickly turn into an old hag like Ms. Trunchbull.)</P><P>

The woman above is obviously tranny. The thing is, I'm honestly
embarassed of myself I didn't realize this before. <STRONG>If
feminism aims to rid men of women's lives, obviously they're
gonna become trannies!</STRONG> Honestly, you should have
realized that before.</P>

<H2>The Last Argument</H2><P>

I think I have not been sounding smart hitherto. Therefore,
I shall make this intellectual argument: women, by nature,
seek men who resemble their fathers to marry; unless they have
daddy issues, that is. If men are effeminate faggots (by the
way, <A HREF="fags.htm">feminism turns men into faggots</A>),
the very women will resemble women's fathers more than men, so
they will go after women. It is a shame but it is true. Or
leaving the father-thing aside, women, by nature, seek strong
men that they may take care of them and their children. But if
women are stronger than men, women will go after women.</P>

<H2>Conclusion</H2><P>

I really wish I could make myself clearer, but I think I may
not have. Perhaps if you ignore everything and just consider
the image above, it will be less confusing.</P><P>

What did you think about this article? Did you read through it?
Good for you! You have further enlightened yourself. Please
consider leaving me an <A HREF="../msc/email.htm">email</A>. I
personally like this black and white, straight-to-the-point
style. (I had a whole design with a background image, but
honestly it just looked cluttered and messy.)</P>
