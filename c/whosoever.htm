For, oh brother, even St. Paul was saved, and he used to persecute Christians. Not only that, nevertheless he became a saint! Jesus Chr-st is our <A HREF="https://jesus-is-savior.com/salvation_webpages/14-jesus_our_propitiation.htm">propitiation</A> (He atoned for our sins), whereby, and by no other means, men can be saved.<P>

I know that <STRONG><EM>whosoever believeth in Him</EM></STRONG> can be saved, for it is not by <EM>our</EM> righteousness that we are saved but by the righteousness of Christ.<P>

I like this quote from <A HREF="https://Jesus-is-Savior.com" REL="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">Jesus-Is-Savior</A>. I would like to share it with you because it highlights a rather subtle message of God's forgiveness in scriptures. Take a look:

We read in 2nd Peter 2:1, <I>"But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord <STRONG>that bought them</STRONG>, and bring upon themselves swift destruction."</I> Did you see that?</FONT><P><FONT COLOR="#006600" SIZE=4 FACE="Verdana,sans-serif">

Jesus bought those false prophets, even though they were bound for Hell in their sins. Oh! Listen my friend - I don't care what sins you may have committed, or how far from God you may have run - you may still come to Jesus for forgiveness and salvation. This is Biblical.

That's right, the Bible says Jesus died even for those who denied Him. Now, they are not saved, but they <EM>can</EM> be saved, For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
