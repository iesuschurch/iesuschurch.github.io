Only the <A HREF="http://kingjamesBible.com">Holy Inspired King James Bible</A> is trustworthy. For behold, all other Bible versions perver the Bible. Most particularly, the NIV perverts Christianity's dearest verse, John 3:16, into a <EM>LIE!</EM>

Do you then suppose that words don't matter when it comes to the word of God?<P>

Consider also that it perverts it into a <EM>LIE.</EM> How shall we read Bible versions with lies? Romans 3:4

Amen. It is bad enough that <A HREF="../chrch/index.htm">preachers are liars</A>, but that the <EM>Bible</EM>, the Word of God, be turned into a lie? That is another level of iniquity. That verse is perfect for today. I dedicate that verse, Romans 3:4, to all those who <A HREF="https://jesus-is-savior.com/Bible/1611_authorized_king_james.htm">pervert the Bible</A> and to all those who <A HREF="../chrch/index.htm">teach heresey</A>. You may be a liar, but God isn't.
