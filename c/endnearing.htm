approach the End Times as prophecized in the Bible daily, wherefore it is expedient that ye turn to  God and be not in apostasy, for ye know not when Jesus Christ arriveth. He could arrive while ye are masturbating. He could arrive in the middle of your dirty joke. He could arrive in the middle of your argument with your family. Ye must be careful, for God could arrive at any time. He could literally be here while ye are reading this article. Jesus Christ said the same:</P>

<H2>Money</H2><P>

We are already seeing how money is becoming more digitalized and consequently more controlled. We first had gold, then paper, then checks, then credit cards, then cryptocurrencies, and now you can pay things with your phone. We have apps to <STRONG>buy or sell.</STRONG> It is obvious what is happening; besides that people are becoming lazier and addicted to technology, the Mark of the Beast approaches. For thereby can no man buy or sell. If we only used gold, enforcing such policy would be harder, but with this big surverillance grid, such is very easy. I easily see all the peasants scanning vaccine-certification QR codes to buy using the only way available, CashApp.</P>

<H2>Tatoos</H2><P>

People are getting more and more tatoos. It is becoming increasingly acceptable worldwide. Across the nation, even teenagers are getting tatoos. However, we must remember what the Mark of the Beast is: Revelatiosn 13:16</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads:

Tatoos are becoming more acceptable that one day people won't think it's weird to get the Mark of the Beast tatooed.</P>

<H2>Vaccines</H2><P>

The Beast System is already in place. The vaccine passport is <A HREF="http://kingjamesbible.com/B66C013.htm#V16" TITLE="And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads:" ONCLICK="alert(this.title);return false;">Revelations 13:16</A> come true. Vaccines are already required for many jobs. Soon, CashApp will require proof of vaccination to use their services. Increasingly we lose bodily autonomy, and as we lose bodily autonomy, putting a Mark on our bodies becomes easier for the Beast.</P>

<H2>Bill Gates Paves the Way</H2><P>

The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation funds vaccines worldwide. Anthony Fauci was out there shilling vaccines. What I'm saying is all these people are working for the Beast, paving the way as John the Baptist paved the way for Jesus. (Although this is much more sinister.) They are setting up the infrastructure. All the things about living forever is probably so they live long enough to see the Anti-Christ.</P>

<H2>Conclusion</H2><P>

Everything lines up. The world is getting ready to accept the Mark of the Beast. Bill Gates, Karl Schwab, and others are setting up the infrastructure for the beast. Was society smart, we would take measures to make such scenario impossible like, for starters, returning bodily autonomy.</P><P>

<LI>And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads:
<LI>And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.
<LI>Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six.
