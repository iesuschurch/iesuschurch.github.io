Abortion, mass shootings, rape, theft, gluttony, and murder all have one thing in common - their cause, neglecting God. Behold, we lie to our children that they are the product of deaths, survival of the fittest, and selfishnes while expecting them to behave morally. Good luck with that! No wonder the <A HREF="https://jesus-is-savior.com/Evils%20in%20Government/Federal%20Reserve%20Scam/united_states_is_in_deep_doodoo.htm">U.S. is in deep trouble.</A></P>

We live in a society that glorifies animal living - intercourse, gluttony, no religion, etc. all without the freedom of animals. They're making monkeys out of us. We have devolved into fatmericans who have neglected God and ethics for the primitive search of dopamine. That's why they see nothing wrong with ramming your penis into <A HREF="../gay/index.htm">another man's poop.</A><P>

How can we allow them to destroy morals by a hoax? The <A HREF="../gay/index.htm">consequences</A> are manifest.<P ALIGN="center">

Why is cheating wrong? The purpose of life is to reproduce!<BR>
Why is whoredom wrong? The more genetic variety, the better!<BR>
Why is whoremongery wrong? survival of the fittest!<P>

Why is bestiality wrong? We literally descended from monkeys!<BR>
Why are orgies wrong? Homo sapiens did it all the time!<BR>
Why is inmodesty wrong? We need to reproduce!<P>

Why get married? Sex is just an exchange of pleasures!<BR>
Why not kill my children (abortion)? Morality is relative!<BR>
Why go to church? It's just a man-made institution.<P>

Why not eat up? We are made to store nutrients!<BR>
Why not smoke weed? We are just a clump of cells.<BR>
Why not live a virtual reality? Life is just chemicals in the brain.

"Survival of the fittest, bro!" Do you see why evolution is so detrimental to society? Why Christians must oppose it? People say

If we're just a clump of cells and elements in the brain, is there anything better than cocaine?

Because of the evil evolution hoax. That's what I mean by "Don't let Satan make a monkey out of you." Evolution is of Satan, and it's making monkeys out of millions, and it's damning their souls to hell!

Babies are being aborted. Kids are being mutilated. Rape is rampant. Pornography is rampant. Drugs are rampant. We are truly living hell on earth, and it is because man has forgotten God, and that's becasue of <EM>evolution.</EM> America has become a cesspool of humanity; it has become a cesspool of deparvity. Behold what happens when nations forget God! <A HREF="https://soulwinning.info/sermons/hp032016.mp3">Proverbs 9:17</A>

The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God.

Amen! God prophesized and He was right! Throughout my life, over and over again, I always think "Man, God was always right."<P>

You know, I wrote about how America has turned into hell without that passage in mind, and then found it and found it awe-inspiring that it was exactly what I was talking about. <A HREF="http://KingJamesBible.com">Read the Bible</A>, for it really does apply to the current day and forever. Psalms 119:152
