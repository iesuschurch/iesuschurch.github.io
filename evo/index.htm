David J. Stewart is absolutely right! Now, a gorilla is not your grandfather no matter what, but believing it turns you <A HREF="monkey.htm">into a gorilla</A>. For behold, believing evolution really does require you turn off your brain and be quiet. For as soon as you ask questions, the whole thing falls apart. That's how it is with hoaxes. Questions/truths like

And <A HREF="https://jesus-is-savior.com/Evolution%20Hoax/soul_and_spirit.htm">other questions</A> that I can't elegantly express in bullet points make evolution fall completely apart.<P>

That's why they want to teach it to young kids. They know if you're not indoctrinated as a child, you'll ask questions, and you will not believe it. For as soon as questions arise, evolution falls apart.

Evolution is a hoax. But devolution is vey real. Every day we see society devolve into <A HREF="../p0rn/index.htm">rotten filthiness</A>. We see men devolve into soyboy beta males.<P>

Now, I'm speaking metaphorically. Evolution is a hoax. What we observe is the awful phenomenom of <!--<A HREF="domestication.htm">-->Human Domestication<!--</A>--> as well as plastics, soy (has estrogen),

Why is evolution so taught in schools without any questioning of the doctrines thereof? Because, like all hoaxes, it cannot take questions. Why, then, is it taught? Because the <A HREF="http://www.crossroad.to/articles2/011/ConformingChurch.htm">New World Order</A> wants everyone atheist. They demand loyalty to the government, not to God. It is for the same reason they destroyed the family.<P>

But not only that. It goes deeper than that. Why would they seek all these things evil in the eyes of God? They are satanic. And the <A HREF="https://jesus-is-savior.com/False%20Religions/Illuminati/new_world_order.htm">New World Order</A> is satanic.

Was the beauty seen above created by evolution? It is obvious that it wasn't just by looking at it. But thankfully, you don't have to rely on common sense to to know the truth; evolution is a hoax. Please refer to the free online books below:<P>
