<I>Herein Iesus Church explores the effects of domestication and argues that men are themselves becoming domesticated, showing the same signs of domestication such as no territorality, no assertiveness, effeminacy, frailty, etc.. He compares the patheticness of the house pet eager for his tummy to be rubbed compared to the hungry wolf and that of the modern soy man to the Founding Fathers.</I><P>

It seems good, yet it has greater, over-arching consequences for generations to come. They are noticable at first, but eventually a new species is created, alien to its former self, and the new one is taken as normal.<P>

ehold, <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domesticated_silver_fox">foxes</A> were  domesticated in Russia. Docile foxes were bred for generations until nearly all the foxes were tamed. And behold, these domesticated foxes develop curly tails and floppy ears. They are no longer as their independent ancestors were but rely on humans to scratch their tummies. Wherefore tell I thee this? Lo, humans are undergoing the same phenomenom. I coin it H<SMALL>UMAN</SMALL> D<SMALL>OMESTICATION</SMALL>.

Based on my understanding of the Jeffersonian idea of the yeoman farmer or tradesman , no . We are not meant to be NPC'S. The NPC is part of a postindustrial behavioral sink. Where in people have been divorced from the land for generations and have to a degree been domesticated into human cultivars incapable of the rugged lifestyle of their pioneer forefathers. Consider if you will<BR>

This is in my opinion a result of domestication syndrome.<BR>

the tales of domesticated foxes get curly and the ears get floppy. We can with the right set of eyes see this in people begining with a grain diet and city life culminating into what we have today. The weak jaw, decreased alveolar bone mass, wider eyes (the moon face) , lower IQ, suggestibility, lower levels of testosterone. These are a direct result of cultural processes on human reproduction. There are many out there who would not exist in a more violent past. We have entered into a new phase of human evolution.<BR>

Behold, O thou city-dweller, how thou hast become domesticated. Thou hast degenerated. Thou hast devolved. Americas' men's <A HREF="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2022/05/09/fact-check-testosterone-levels-lower-25-1999-2016/7381735001/">testosterone has dropped by 25%</A> from 1999 to 2016. All this amounts to what I'm trying to tell you: you are being domesticated. You are being turned into a house pet. You are being made pathethic.<P>

Testosterone is necessary for men to build muscles. It grows large balls (literally) amongst other things. Please reads directly from Wikipedia:<P>

In humans, testosterone plays a key role in the development of <STRONG>male reproductive tissues</STRONG> such as testes and prostate, as well as promoting secondary sexual characteristics such as increased <STRONG>muscle and bone mass</STRONG>, and the growth of body hair, and psychological characteristics in males such as increased <STRONG>aggression, sex drive, the inclination to impress partners</STRONG> and other courting behaviors.[4] In addition, testosterone in both sexes is involved in health and well-being, where it has a significant effect on overall mood, <STRONG>cognition</STRONG>, social and sexual behaviour, <STRONG>metabolism</STRONG> and <STRONG>energy output</STRONG>, the cardiovascular system, and in the prevention of osteoporosis.[5][6] Insufficient levels of testosterone in men may lead to abnormalities including frailty, accumulation of adipose fat tissue within the body, anxiety and depression, sexual performance issues, and bone loss.

So, take out all those things, and that's what the tamed modern man is becoming. We must go back to the wilderness. We are becoming domesticated.

I do not think I made myself clear. Let me start on a different page. Forget the foxes; read this Wikipedia <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestication#Effects">article section</A> instead (if you want to know the truth, that is.
