Church is evil. I am Christian. I am telling you this to <EM>save</EM> you.

<H2>Why Do You Go?</H2><P>

Sit down. Now tell me, why do you go to church?<P>

Why don't you just listen to <A HREF="https://jesus-is-savior.com/Books,%20Tracts%20&%20Preaching/Audio%20Sermons/audio_sermons.htm" REL="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">sermons online</A>? Because you are not going to church for the sermon.<P>

Why don't you just read the <A HREF="http://kingjamesBible.com">Bible</A>? Becase you are not going to church for the Bible.<P>

You don't care about the sermon. You don't care about the Bible. You don't care about God. You're only going for the other thing. <STRONG>You're only going to church for the people!</STRONG>

<H2>Sinful Motives</H2><P>

Thus we realize you're not going to church for the sermons nor for the Bible but only for the people. What does the Bible say about this? <A HREF="http://kingjamesbible.com/B40C015.htm">Matthew 15:8</A>

<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG><FONT COLOR="red">
This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me.</FONT></STRONG>
</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

"I'm sincere!" you may say. Well, if you were going to church for the sermons or the Bible, you wouldn't be going to church. You'd be reading the Bible or listening to sermons.

<H2>Nullified Prayer</H2><P>

Why do you pray in church? <STRONG>God won't answer those prayers.</STRONG> You prayed because you wanted to bow down your head like everyone else, to fit in. Verily I say unto you, you had your reward. <A HREF="http://kingjamesbible.com/B40C006.htm">Matthew 6:5-6</A>

<OL START=5>
<LI>And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the <STRONG>hypocrites</STRONG> are: for they <STRONG>love to pray standing in the synagogues [churches]</STRONG> and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, <STRONG>They have their reward.</STRONG>
<LI>But thou, <STRONG>when thou prayest, enter into thy closet [not thy church]</STRONG>, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret <STRONG>shall reward thee openly. [over church goers!]</STRONG>
</OL><P>

You are wasting your time praying in the synagogue. Go to your closet and pray. Why doesn't the church teach you that? They don't care about God. They care about money.

<H2>Greed</H2><P>

Churches are preaching for money, not for God. <A HREF="http://kingjamesbible.com/B54C006.htm#V5">1 Timothy 6:10</A><BLOCKQUOTE>

For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

I know this because, behold, why do churches do all these sinful things like women preachers, <A HREF="https://jesus-is-savior.com/Evils%20in%20America/devils_music_no_effect.htm">rock music</A>, and homosexuality? Or why do they forsake teaching modesty, <A HREF="http://kingjamesbible.com/B43C002.htm#V11">Jesus and the whip</A>, or the sin of race-mixing?
