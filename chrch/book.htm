Why do you pray in church? Because you wanted to bow down your head like everybody else, to fit in. Verily I say unto you, you have had your reward. Matthew 6:5

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>
And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the <STRONG>hypocrites</STRONG> are: for they love to pray standing in the <STRONG>synagogues<SUP>[churches]</SUP></STRONG> and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I sau nto you, <STRONG>They have their reward.</STRONG>

So why do you prain in church? It is practically useless. It is also a waste of time. Why go to church when you can read the Bible? And if you really need someone to interpret it for you, just listen to a sermon. This is all obvious, but you wouldn't stop going to church, for you are only going for the people. What does

I decided digitalization of books is gay and evil. Why does <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_von_Ahn">Luid von Ahn</A>, inventor of <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReCAPTCHA">ReCAPTCHA</A>, a book digitalizer, is so invested in digitalizing books? Besides the pursuit of money, it is because they are trying to get rid of real books or expect real books to no longer exist and everything will be fake. If you read Fahrenheit 451, you should know how important real books and the experiences thereof are. Therefore I say if you want to read my book, you won't do it online. Instead, get out of the internet and go read books at the library, you little piece of shrimp mother father. And go freak yourself while you're at it, mutt.
