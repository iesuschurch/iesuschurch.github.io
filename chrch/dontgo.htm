are evil. They are the home of priestcrafts and many teach abominations. Don't go to church.

<H2>Evil</H2><P>

Many churches teach abominable heresies. And what about the ones that don't? I bet 99% of churches are not entirely correct.<P>

Do not believe the lies that a church is better than no church. That is simply not true. Churches that teach abominable heresies, even if just one, are an evil influence and should be purged from your life. Otherwise you may open up to these abominable heresies, and so may your children, and if it's concerning salvation, you just damned you and your children because "a church is better than no church."

"One abominable heresy is enough a reason to not go to church.<BR>
'A church is better than no church' is a simply not true."
</DIV><DIV ALIGN="right">
<I>- This nigga</I></DIV><HR><P>

It's been years since I've been to church, but when I was a child, to me, church was boring as rocks. If you take your children there, they will become disinterested in church and therefore God. It is better that you captivate them reading Bible stories to them.

<H2>Perversions</H2><P>

Churches often pervert the Bible, God, or His teachings for the purpose of appealing to audiences. The problem, of course, is then you end with a watered-down version of Christianity which is what we have today. And priests need to attract people to make money.<P>

How do you think we got rock music into church? They wanted to appeal to people. Why do you think you haven't heard the story of <A HREF="http://kingjamesbible.com/B43C002.htm#V11">Jesus and the whip?</A> Because they didn't want to scare away people, and pastors are getting money off of this.

<H3>Women Preachers</H3><P>

Again, women preachers are another priestcraft in search to increase church attendance (for money), thus perverting Christianity. It is abominable, for the Bible clearly speaks against this: 1 Timothy 2:11-15

<OL START=11>
<LI>Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.
<LI>But I <STRONG>suffer not a woman to teach</STRONG>, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.
<LI>For Adam was first formed, then Eve.
<LI>And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression.
<LI>Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety.
</OL><P>

Bet you haven't heard that verse in church, huh? Why? <STRONG>They don't care about the truth; they care about money!</STRONG> They may say it's for "soul-winning", but then why would they do so with abominations? Clearly they don't care about God.

<HR><DIV CLASS="q">
"Why would they attract people to church with sin?<BR>
They don't care about God; they care about money."

<H2>Fake Christians</H2><P>

Church is full of fake christians. <STRONG>Women don't actually believe in God. Church is just a social thing from them.</STRONG> The problem with church is church is too social. It turns into a social thing instead of something for God. That is why there are women in church. Although one may say "whatever it takes for soul-winning," how often will these people in it for the fun will actually be saved?

<HR><BIG>
Really, why go to church when you can read the Bible? Isn't that what you're going there for, Bible lessons? Or if you want a sermon, why not turn on Christian radio? You're not there for the lesson. You're there for the people, and so are others. So much for a "church".</BIG><HR><P>

For more than a millenia, people have been going to church for social reasons. What makes you think things have changed? If their friends are there or there parents are there or whatever, they're gonna go. If they want to know people, same thing. It's full of fake Christians. Don't go to church, man.

<H2>Heresies</H2><P>

Throughout my youth they told us <I>"This place is the house of God."</I> Absolutely not true! It is just a building where preachers collect money and people socialize. They teach that so you go; I guess. Man, and you think those people who are lying to you have good intentions? They're not doing it for God, for if they were, they wouldn't lie to you. <STRONG>They're doing it for money.</STRONG>

<H2>Phony</H2>

Churches are too phony. You and your family get ready to go there on Sunday morning, try to get there on time with a nice, semi-formal outfit, pretend to listen for an hour straight while standing up, try to behave like everyone else, ask no questions, and leave. Or in those "non-traditional" churches or Sunday school, you go, talk to a bunch of people for no reason about things that don't matter that the (female) preacher made you talk about, sit down, and listen to same sermon. Then you talk about what you just heard even though it's obvious or talk about non-important questions, and she talks more, and you leave. It's evil. Woe unto children who grow up like this.

<H2>Why Are You Going?</H2><P>

You're going to socialize, because like a woman, you don't care about God; you care about socializing (or out of ignorance). This I know because:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Why not just read your Bible? You're not going for the Scripture.<BR>
Why not just listen to a sermon on the radio or online?  You're not going for the sermon.
</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

That's right; you're going for the people. Now, you may say there is nothing wrong with this, but the answer is there is! For behold, all these people are going "in the name of God", but none care about God. They care about socializing. For otherwise they wouldn't be going to church. How do you think God feels about this? The unsincere praises of the lips of millions? This is what He says: Matthew 15:8

<BLOCKQUOTE><I>This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me.</I></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2>Don't Go to Church</H2><P>

Just don't and listen to <A HREF="https://jesus-is-savior.com/Books,%20Tracts%20&%20Preaching/Audio%20Sermons/audio_sermons.htm" REL="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">online sermons</A> and read the Bible. May God help you in your journey and free you from heresy. Also, pray much, for it is prayer by yourself that counts. Matthew 6:5

<OL START=5>
<LI>And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray <STRONG>standing in the synagogues [chuches]</STRONG> and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, <STRONG>They have their reward. [social approval]</STRONG>
<LI>But thou, when thou prayest, <STRONG>enter into thy closet [not church]</STRONG>, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.
</OL><P>

Just don't go, man! Down with churches, man! If you're gonna build a church, may it just be so it's pretty and remind people of God, but just put a sign that says "Read the Bible", "Read these sermons", "Listen to our radio station", or "Visit our website for sermons" and "If you want to socialize, go put up a sign that says 'I WANT FRIENDS.' Just don't come here trying to meet people pretending you care about God."<P ALIGN="center">
