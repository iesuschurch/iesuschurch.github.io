What's that you say? Why should I stop going to church? What's that you called me? Why do I hate God? Behold, I do not hate God; I love God. I am Christian, and I love you too, brother. Why, then, am I promoting this seemingly unChristian idea that we ought stop going to church? because church is evil.<P>

I am not joking. Woe unto me if I joke about such things. I am speaking the truths, and if I did not believe the things I was saying, I would be a liar, and it would have been better that I had not spoken. But I do believe these things, insomuch that I wrote a book about them, and have <A HREF="dontgo.htm">articles</A> up <A HREF="dontgo-w.htm">about it</A>, too. I am hoping to get more articles up.

<DL>
<DT><B>Why oppose church?</B>
<DD><A HREF="book.htm">Read the book</A> and find out, or alternatively, read my <A HREF="dontgo.htm">articles</A> answering that exact question in great detail. Basically, for a lot of reasons.

<DT><B>Don't you fear God?</B>
<DD>I do, and very much. But behold, society has made it we associate church with God, wherefore criticizing church seems taboo. But if church brings upon evils, sins, and heresies against God, what else shall I do?

- Marthin Luther (1483-1546)<P>

It is far from my intent - yea, far be it from me - to lead people away from God. It <EM>is</EM> my intent, though, to have people <EM>really</EM> pray, to really worship, to really learn, and as pleases God, free of heresies and bearing forth great fruits.

<DT><B>Is the book free?</B>
<DD>Yes, and without shipping, for it is <A HREF="book.htm">available</A> free on this site. You can even print it, and it's free (except for the ink and paper).

<DT><B>Can I copy it?</B>
<DD>Yes, I have no copyright. You can literally call it yours if you want. If you become famous from it, though, I will let everyone know you're a liar!

<DT><B>So how do you profit therefrom?</B>
<DD>I don't and will not. May my reward be to expound truth. If you have scruples about reading it, don't worry; I don't get a single cent therefrom.
