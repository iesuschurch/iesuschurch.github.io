<H1>About</H1><P>

This book starts off with a dialogue between me and a church-attender over why he goes to church. It then moves on to explain why church is vain. I then say why church is evil, listing multiple reasons, then the evidence church is greedy, and finally saying what the solution to church is.<P>

This book is a religious book. Unlike the title may suggest, it is not an atheist book. I believe in God and read the Bible. I do not, however, attend church, as you may already guessed. I do not seek to lead anyone away from Christ either. Yea, far be it from me to do such a wicked thing. It is my goal to help people praise better and to lead them away from hypocrisy. Matthew 6:5

And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the <STRONG>hypocrites</STRONG> are: for they love to pray standing in the <STRONG>synagogues [churches]</STRONG> and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.

I make often use of Scripture throughout the book.<P>

<STRONG>W<SMALL>ARNING</SMALL>: </STRONG> Sincere apologies go to anyone whom I may offend through the manner in which I presen my ideas. Yes, it will likely be offensive, perhaps upsetting, for those who may have grown up in the church and are very dear to it. But, of course, you are a man, so you will just internalize this sadness and take thoughtful decisions accordingly as men do. I am just telling you in case you are about to go to a wedding and don't want to be thoughtful or bleak throughout the wedding. If that is the case, wait for the wedding to pass and then read the book.
