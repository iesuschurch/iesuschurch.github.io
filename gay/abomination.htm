T<SMALL>HE</SMALL> L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL> accurately said throughout
his word that being gay is abomination. That's what God calls it,
wherefore it is what I call it. But you don't have to be Christian
to realize that homosexuality is abomination. Here is the proof:

<H2>Poopy Penis</H2><P>

Homosexuals (or <EM>sodomites</EM> as the Bible calls them) ram their
penises into each other's anus. That's where they poop from!
If they didn't clean themselves well enough earlier, their penis
is going to come out with poop. God calls that abomination. I think
that is perfectly reasonable.

Semen goes through the rectum straight up the colon (poop).
Where do you see "Penis goes here?"</I>
</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>

Homosexuals ejaculate into each other's poop.
Look at the diagram (not photograph!) of the anus and rectum. Do you
know what it means? Semen goes from the rectum straight into the
poop! So they are literally ejaculating into each other's poop.
When they poop, it'll probably come out with semen as well! God
calls it abomination; I think God is the only one with common
sense nowadays.

<H2>Poopy Fists</H2><P>

Homosexual shove their entire fist into another man's anus call it
"love". Nigga, that's <EM>far</EM> from love. It is a complete
perversion of the truth when they call it "love". It is
<EM>abomination!</EM> God knows, and God is honest, wherefore He
calls abomination
abomination. He doesn't call it "love". Shoving your fist into
another mans' anus is NOT love, no matter how society brainwashes
you to think otherwise.<P>

Don't be a fatmerican. "Oh no, shoving fists into other
mans' anus is an unalienable right! We must fight wars for other
men's right to shove their fist into other men's anus! It's our
values and who we are!"</P><CENTER><I>

"Love is not shoving your fist into another man's anus, thus causing
it to bleed and disfiguring their butthole."

Yes, they lick each other's assholes. Do you understand why people
where so "intolerant" and "unaccepting" of "just another sexual
orientation"?

<H2>STD - But Why?</H2><P>

With all the facts aforementioned, it is truly a mistery as to why
sodomites get so many STDs...

<H2>Love?</H2><P>

Of course it's love, you biggot. Licking man's anus is the ultimate
form of love.

<H2>Sin?</H2><P>

Of course not, you Bible-thumber. Licking man's anus is the holiest
act. Why else did God create the butthole?
