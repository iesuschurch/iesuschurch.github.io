America is doomed! We tell toddlers they're the opposite sex, and get surgeries because America is obsessed with mutilating children! <A HREF="https://jesus-is-savior.com/Evils%20in%20America/Pride/stiffnecked.htm">America is far more wicked than Sodom and Gomorrah!</A>

<HR><P>

Do not be deceived; do NOT support the homosexual agenda! They're always talking about acceptance, speaking against "bigotry" - man, I'll preach against ramming your penis into another man's poop no matter how crazy the world is. It's just like Hamlet, everyone is crazy except the "crazy" one. Seriously, homosexuals ram their penis into other man's poop. If they didn't clean themselves well enough after pooping, the penis comes out with poop. Why do you think God calls it <A HREF="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/k/kjv/kjv-idx?type=citation&book=Leviticus&chapno=18&startverse=22">abomination</A>? That's what ramming your penis into another mans' anus is, abomination! And don't even get me started on other gay acts...

<HR>

It is not biggotry; it is the truth. <A HREF="g-d-homophobic.htm">God agrees</A>, and <A HREF="science-homophobic.htm">science agrees.</A> And common sense agrees for the reasons stated above. I mean, it's obvious, and it's a shame upon the nation that I have to say such obvious things. It really tells you how deranged the world is. Man truly needs God, for without God, we are lead astray into all sorts of dark paths. America needs Jesus; only Jesus can save us.<P ALIGN="center">

This is what the Bible says about women who trannify their kids: Isaiah 3:12

<BLOCKQUOTE ID="verse">
<A NAME="isa3v12">
As for my people, children are their oppressors, and <STRONG>women rule over them.</STRONG> O my people, <STRONG>they which lead thee cause thee to err</STRONG>, and destroy the way of thy paths.
</A>
</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

Mothers should protect their children against the satanic New World Order and train up their children in the word of God. Instead, these women are leading destroying the way of their paths like Isaiah foretold. Woe unto mankind.<P>

You know, it's kind of just sad, watching all these kids get mutilated in the name of popular ideologies as their parents celebrate. They will never get their genitals back, and all this happened because they grew up during this madness. Their turning their children into guys like the one in the <A HREF="butch-homo.gif">photo</A> above. I don't even know that guy. I just found in on <A HREF="https://Jesus-is-Savior.com">JIS</A> lol.

<HR><P>

I've often quoted Leviticus 18:22 herein, but the problem with that is I have heard Christians neglect God's commandment saying "That's the Old Testament. It doesn't apply to us." They couldn't be further from the truth! God did away with ceremonial laws, but the law is still there. Just as sacrificing to Moloch was a sin back then, it's a sin now. And just was ramming your penis into another man's poop was abomination then, it's abomination now. But regardless, the New Testament <EM>does</EM> preach against the evils of sodomy (what the Bible calls homosexuality). <A HREF="http://kingjamesbible.com/B45C001.htm#V26">Romans 1:26-27</A>

<OL START=26>
<LI>For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:
<LI>And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.
</OL><P>

Although I believe the "recompence of their error" was "a reprobate mind" as we later see in the chapter, I also believe it was STDs. Anyways, so there you have it; both Old and New Testament agree that homosexuality is a sin. Besides, God literally wiped out entire cities, <A HREF="http://kingjamesbible.com/B01C019.htm">Sodom and Gomorrah</A>, probably for being gay, so it's definitely no longer a sin as many of these "Christians" claim.

America is mentally ill. We have forgotten the words of God and have strayed into all sorts of madness. We mutilate children, and men ram their penis into other men's anus.<P>

Did you know when homosexuals have sex, their buttholes are spread apart so much they have to wear diapers? It's absolutely disgusting. If they don't clean themselves before sex, their penis comes out with poop. Who knows, some gays may like it with poop. No wonder they get STDs. <A HREF="g-d-homophobic.htm">God is 100% right</A>, <A HREF="abomination.htm">homosexuality is abominable!</A> And "abomination" is no exaggeration; such perfectly describes such perverted acts.

Think about it: was America a Christian nation, had we not forgotten God, millions of genitals would not have been mutilated. The lives of the 70 million aborted babies since Roe v. Wade would not have perished. We are in desperate need of God, in Heaven for without him we shall perish (John 3:16) but also on earth.
