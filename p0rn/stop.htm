<FONT SIZE="6" FACE="serif"><B>M</B></FONT>asturbation is a horrible sin straight from the pits of Hell. It is the lowest point a man can ever be in, the most embrassing state. It is disgraceful to your own body. How can you look at your family knowing what you did earlier? That same liquid you flush down the damn sink you create life with. That's the same liquid from which you were born, damn it! This behavior is evil, shameful, lowly. Masturbation turns kings into the scum of the earth.</P><P>

If you are locked in your room all day, it is not mistery what's going to happen. You will stay negative, private, and behold: if you have access to thousands of women, each more beautiful than the other, why just stand around? Why just read articles when you could be getting it down with 10 women all at once? (That is not meant to trigger you.) Of course you're going to end up where you were.</P>

<H3><A NAME="overeat">Do Not Over-eat</A></H3><P>

You are more likely to masturbate if you are full. I am not asking you to fast, just don't let yourself have a swollen stomach that makes you say: Man, I'm full! Think of it: your body seeks to keep itself alive by eating. Surival supercedes reproduction. So, when you're well full, eating exits the mind and the second priority takes over... By not being totally full, food will never leave the priorities and thus temptation will decrease.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>
But besides that, if you just relapsed, you gotta destimulate your brain... When you're [masturbating], when you're in the town, your brain is overstimulated of all these pixels you see on the screen of you going to ham. You're releasing all types of dopamine. Bruh, you['re] going crazy. You['re] going crazy. Like, that's why it feels so good at the moment, and you wanna keep doing it again, bruh. Like, that's how you develop that addiction. It feels good, okay?...</P><P>

And the reason why I'm saying all this [is] because we really need to reprogram our minds into not wanting that two second-sensation... So, reprogram your brain. Some things you guys can do is to meditate. So, you just relapsed, really go meditate. Go outside for a walk. Do not go on social media whatsoever.</P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>

Exactly. I say you pray. Get in a closet (<A HREF="http://KingJamesBible.com/B40C006.htm#V6" TITLE="But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly." ONCLICK="alert(this.title);return false;">Matthew 6:6</A>), close your eyes, and pray. For indeed, fireworks go on in your chemicals during orasm <A HREF="https://physicsforums.com/threads/pet-scan-during-orgasms-like-heroine-shots.8685/">much like heroine</A>, and your brain doesn't want to go down. It wants to stay at a constant high. To meditate, to destimulate your brain, is to tell it No and to take control of yourself. That's what you need, for only with temperance will you succeed in this challenge. So, remember, pray, read the Bible, meditate in prayer, destimulate.</P>

Write down why you're not masturbating so that you remember during your hardest times. It will be an inspiration and help you destimulate when you're aroused. Here is something that your list could look like:</P>

<FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS,Comic Sans,sans-serif">
<UL>
<LI>It's a sin. (Matthew 5:28 But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart. - Jesus)</LI>
<LI>It depletes tesosterone.</LI>

</UL>
</FONT>

<H3><A NAME="read">Read the Bible Daily</A></H3><P>

Daily Bible reading is a daily reminder of God and His power. If you read the Bible daily, whatever happens in your life, at the end of the day you will settle down and remember God and His commandments. That also applies to masturbation. You will remember there is a God that is always watching you, and you will refrain from defiling your body for your own selfish, lowly pleasures. Remember, we are called to self-denial, not self-gratification.</P>

<H3><A NAME="pray">Pray Daily</A></H3><P>

It is very important that you pray, for without God we can do nothing, for nothing was made but by God. It's time for that famous verse, Phillippians 4:13: I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me. Yea, therefore pray that you may not relapse and disgrace the body you have been bestowed with. Also, pray for other things and pray for others. Pray that such lowly sins may be far from everyone, and that those who contribute to these sins turn from their evil ways.</P>

<H3><A NAME="10pushups">Ten Push-Ups</A></H3><P>

When you are aroused, you are in a very dangerous state. You are on the verge of sin. You are on the verge of losing your <A HREF="semenpoem.htm">soul</A>. You are on the verge of losing your testosterone. Simply put, you are on the verge of losing. Therefore, it is expedient that you do ten push-ups, for these shall de-arouse you. Ten should be enough to get your mind unto other stuff and hopefully de-arouse you. However, if this goal has not yet been met after ten, do another ten. Do fifteen. Remember, just don't sin.</P><P>

And don't think about masturbation while you're doing them. The push-ups are an opportunity to cleanse your mind. You are supposed to cleanse your mind. Think of what you are feeling during the push-ups. Think of how strong you could one day be. Think of anything else that doesn't lead you to lose.

<H2><A NAME="punishment">Punishment</A></H2><P>

So, you have sinned. You have disgraced your body <EM>again.</EM> You have against showed who is stronger, you or the addiction, and have proven who controls who - shame, shame! The punishment is not just to serve justice, to make you suffer for defiling your body. It is also to discourage from doing the lowly thing you did that it may never again happen. Here are the things you must do as punishment:

<H3><A NAME="shower">Take a Cold Shower</A></H3><P>

If you have fornicated, take a cold shower as punishment. You cannot wait, put your feet in the water, etc. You must make it painful. You have done great evils to your body and must pay accordingly. If you don't like it, remember the pain next time you think about masturbating again.</P>

<H3><A NAME="100pushups">Give Me a Hundred Push-Ups</A></H3><P>

And make sure they hurt. Make it painful. You want to make the aftermath as painful as possible to discourage your body from doign that again. You want to train your brain to make that associationg that if it does that, it will undergo great pain.</P>

<H3><A NAME="plank">Plank for Three Minutes</A></H3><P>

Although I wrote three minutes, that's really just what I do. You may do more or less depending on your strength. However, it must be painful. Planking is a great time to remember what you did and beg the Lord for forgiveness, to reflect upon you shameful acts and feel shame therefrom, but to then look at what you are doing and realize you can be a new man.</P>

<H3><A NAME="prayer">A Long Prayer</A></H3><P>

(Although this is not a punishment, for praying is great, it is something that is being forced upon you as a consequence for your actions, so I call it punishment for lack of a better word.) After you fornicate, you have fallen. You are in the ground, as lowly as a man can get, crawling on the mud. It is a low spot, wherefore we realize the only thing one cna do then is to humble themselves before the Lord. Yea, we must turn our face unto God and beg Him forgiveness, and that He may bring you out of this lowly state. For behold, you have semen on your shirt and semen on your laptop. Your hands are filthy and your mind disgusting. Your pants are rolled down and your hand cupped. You NEED God. WE need God. Humble yourself before God and ask forgiveness, for the devil has alreayd humbled you, even as a prostitute. For if you have masturbated, the devil has made a whore out of you.<P>

I must note, however, that you must not stretch out the prayer with vain repetitions (<A HREF="http://KingJamesBible.com/B40C006.htm#V7" TITLE="But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking." ONCLICK="alert(this.title);return false;">Matthew 6:7</A>). Rather, read from the Book of Psalms or something. Or maybe just pray normally, but watch out for vain repetitions.</P>

<H3><A NAME="reading">Give Me 20 Bible Chapters</A></H3><P>

While you grieve over your sin, read 20 Bible chapters. Think, reflect, and pray over them. Ammend the ways of you life. Change your ways, turn away from sin, and think of your commitment thereto as you read these chapters.</P>

<H3><A NAME="positive">Stay Positive</A></H3><P>

It is expedien that you stay positive. It is not so you feel good, for abstinence and righteousness is the only thing that will ultimately make you feel good

(<A HREF="http://kingJamesBible.com/B40C005.htm#6" TITLE="Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled." ONCLICK="alert(this.title);return false;">Matthew 5:6</A>).

It is because it will actually help you. Although I do <EM>not</EM> reccomend brushing it under the carpet and moving on (to then forget it and do it again),
