<I>There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.- 1 Corinthians 6:9</I><P>

reason you are not able to quit masturbating is because you have trusted in yourself to quit. You have trusted in man to quit. But behold, man vanisheth like smoke

Man has no power

Man cannot save you from your flesh, for man loves the works of the flesh. However, it is the L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL> who seeks to save thee. It is He who seeks to redeem thee and to spare thee from the lusts of the flesh.<P>

Therefrom we realize if we want to overcome sin, we must seek look towards our Heavenly Father. Yea, He who created us and loves us, He is willing to help, and in fact, He is desirous that we come unto him, for the Lord is against the lusts of the flesh. Anyhow, let us being our Biblical guide on how to stop masturbating based on Scripture.

<H2>Castration</H2><P>

This is the easiest, clearest, safest way to stop masturbating. Behold, Matthew 19:12 <A HREF="matt19.txt">(I.C. Sermon on Matthew 19!)</A>:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their mother's womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.
</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

However, it is not required, and there are other ways. However, remember it, and tell youself that if you fail to stop, you will castrate yourself.

<H2>Quote the Bible</H2><P>

When Jesus was being tempted by Satan (<A HREF="http://kingjamesBible.com/B40C004.htm">Matthew 4</A>), He quoted Scripture, and thereby did He resist the temptations of Satan. He even refused to eat after fasting for forty days!

<H2>Pray to God</H2><P>

Jesus had this mission: He had be crucified to die for the sins of the world. He could have fled. He knew very well what was going to happen, the great pain and humiliation He was going to endure. However, He resisted the flesh's intrisinc desire for survival. He was grieved, yet He did not leave nor stop His Crucifixion. How was he able to do this? He prayed. He prayed in the <A HREF="http://kingjamesBible.com/B40C026.htm">Garden of Gethsemane</A>. He prayed <A HREF="http://kingjamesBible.com/B40C026.htm">thrice</A>. He prayed in the <A HREF="http://kingjamesBible.com/B40C026.htm">night</A>. And although He was exceeding sorrowful, even unto death

(<A HREF="http://kingjamesBible.com/B40C026.htm#V38" TITLE="Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me." ONCLICK="alert(this.title);return false;">Matthew 26:38</A>), He did not leave.

<H2>Fast</H2><P>

Fasting is chastising for men. It is to deprive the flesh of its power for lustful exhortations to instead focus on the spirit. It is a time for the flesh to lose importance for the soul to grow. It is a time to remember God and forget temptations. Therefore fasting is most expedient unto men for the resisting of temptations, including, as in this case, masturbation.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Is not this the <STRONG>fast</STRONG> that I have chosen? to <STRONG>loose the bands of wickedness [masturbation is wicked]</STRONG>, to <STRONG>undo the heavy burdens [resisting the temptation to masturbate is a burden. By fasting you are not so tempted]</STRONG>, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye <STRONG>break every yoke? [the yoke the flesh has on you, masturbation]</STRONG>

<H2>Armor of God</H2><P>

Ephesians 6:10-13

<OL START=10>
<LI>Finally, my brethren, <STRONG>be strong in the Lord</STRONG>, and in the power of his might.
<LI>Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against <STRONG>the wiles of the devil.</STRONG>
<LI><STRONG>For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities [<FONT COLOR="red">gov. which legalizes porn</FONT>], against powers [<FONT COLOR="red">multi-billion porn industry</FONT>], against the rulers of the darkness of this world [<A HREF="https://thetruthabout.github.io/p0rn.htm">Jews who deliver porn</A>], against spiritual wickedness in high places. [<FONT COLOR="red">Pornographers on their tall towers</FONT>]</STRONG>
<LI>Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.
</OL><P>

Amen, remember who your enemies are, remember who we are fighting against. We are soldiers for God, wherefore put on the armor of God, that we may war against the evil one and the lusts of the flesh. Here is the rest of the chapter: Ephesians 14;-18

<OL START=14>
<LI>Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness;
<LI>And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace;
<LI>Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.
<LI>And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:
<LI>Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;
</OL>

<H2>Marijuana?</H2><P>

I remember, some months ago, I was reading about <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rastafari">Rastafari on Wikipedia</A>, and read that they interpret Revelations 22:2 to be talking about marijuana. Here is the verse:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, was there the tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the <STRONG>healing of the nations.</STRONG>
</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

I mean, I don't know. Perhaps if you smoke marijuana whenever you get an urge to masturbate, you will end the temptation to masturbate. But then you may have a bigger problem to cease smoking. Besides, there are other verses about <A HREF="https://openbible.info/topics/addiction">addiction</A> and <A HREF="https://openbible.info/topics/marijuana">Marijuana</A> that you may want to consider first as well as health concerns.

<H2>Conclusion</H2><P>

<A HREF="index.htm">Don't masturbate.</A> Also, that is as much information as I am currently able to provide, but there aer always <A HREF="index.htm">more resources</A> including the <A HREF="http://kingjamesBible.com/index.htm">Bible</A> for you to educate yourself and thereby arm yourself against sin. Remember to put on the armor of God, and when Satan tempts you, quote Scripture at him.
