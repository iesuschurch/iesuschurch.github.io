<FONT FACE="serif" SIZE=6><B>M</B></FONT>asturbation is a sin straight from the pits of Hell, and that is obvious to any person with common sense. (But sadly, common sense is not that common.) You are abusing the natural faculties we have been given for the dishonorable purposes of carnal pleasure - sin! It is disgraceful and lowly. Yet, there are many <EM>Christians</EM> out there who do not believe masturbation is a sin! Such denial is a perversion of the Bible and denial of the truth. Why are they in such denial that masturbation is a sin? What have they to lose? Oh, right... Are <EM>you</EM> in such denial, or do you realize the Sin of Masturbation?

<H2>God Says It</H2><P>

And by God says it I mean the Bible says it, for the Bible is God's Word.

<DT><STRONG>1 Corinthians 7:9 (Let them marry, not masturbate)</STRONG>
<DD>But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.

<DD>Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.
<DT><STRONG>Romans 14:23 (Is it in faith or sleazy?)</STRONG>
<DD>And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because he eateth not of faith: for whatsoever is not of faith is sin.

<H2>On Matthew 5: Masturbation?</H2><P>

It is very noteworthy that Jesus said Whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart, and then, two verses later, He said If thy  right hand offend thee, cut if off. It is likely to be an indirect reference to masturbation. Interpret your yourselves, <A HREF="http://kingjamesBible.com/B40C005.htm#V27">Matthew 5:27-30</A>:

<OL START=27>
<LI>Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery:
<LI>But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.
<LI>And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.
<LI>And if thy right hand offend thee, cut if off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.
</OL>

<H2>What Would Jesus Do?</H2><P>

Did Jesus masturbate? God forbid. Jesus underwent the same temptations and tribulations of the flesh and daily life as we do, and in fact, to a much greater degree (His crucifixion, forty days in the wilderness, etc.). As Christians, we are called to follow Jesus' example.<P>

Now, think of all the great men, the great Patriarchs, the saints, the martyrs, etc. and tell me: did they masturbate? God forbid! Nay, for we cannot think such of any man, for it is lowly and sinful. And indeed, if ye are going to be great men, do not masturbate, for great men do not masturbate.
