1 We are all in desperate need of God.
2 We need God, for without him we go our own ways.
3 Yea, we depart in the ways of the flesh.
4 We mutilate our children,
  we ram other men,
  we steal incontrollably,
  we need God.
  
5 We sacrifice our children.
6 we record ourself sacrificing our children
7 that 11-year olds may watch it and sacrifice their children,
8 and get addicted thenceforth.

You were once just 11.
You stumbled upon it online.
You were scandalized and shocked.
You did not ask for this.

The dealer shocked you.
The seed of curiosity had been planted.
It was just a matter of time
For you to go back for it.

You started with twerking videos.
You moved on to stripping.
Now you watch triple anal.
You are unrecognizable to your former self.

You had your first great dopamine rush.
You did it three times that day.
You were absolutely thrilled
With the heroine that would be your death.

You never asked for this.
You were just a young Christian boy.
You were in middle or elementary.
You were far too young for that shit.

I hope you enjoyed my poems. I sure hope you don't relate, but, let's
be seriuos here.</P><P>

Porn is evil. Please help me spread the word. I am sure this poem will
be much of your friends' liking. Please share it with them. Feel free
to just copy-paste the text without giving credit. God knows my works.</P><P>

To all my brothers fighting with snakes: you can do this. Download a
porn blocker and pray every day. Pray that the Holy Spirit may help you
through the evils. Let us end with my favorite verse of the Bible, shall we?</P>

Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.
