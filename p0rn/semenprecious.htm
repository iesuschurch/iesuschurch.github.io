S<SMALL>EMEN</SMALL>:
Do N<SMALL>OT</SMALL> Waste Your Soul</A><P>

I read this awesome Wikipedia article on <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm_competition">
Sperm Competition (must read)</A> and realized something very deep,
something society is ignorant to due to the evils thereof (namely
<A HREF="mind-control.htm">pornography</A>), and it
is that <FONT COLOR="green"><STRONG>semen is precious</STRONG></FONT>.
Semen is the essence of life, for thereby are men made, and therein
is the male essence of life, testosterone. But more than that, for
I already knew that, I learnt that semen is a scarce resource which
must be treasured for reproduction.<P>

Behold, organisms only have so much semen. They need this semen to
reproduce. When a man copulates, semen is depleted, so the body must
get back to semen production. We are constantly producing semen
because it is absolutely necessary for the survival of species. We
need many things to produce semen, for semen really is a precious
resource.

<H2>The Importance Poem</H2><P>

Let me express it poetically with analogies.</P>

<PRE><FONT FACE=",Courier New,Courier,monospace" SIZE=3><B>
9 Semen is like gold to the body,
8 	for the body desires it so.
9 Semen is like a concealed carry;
8	always have it; you never know.

9 Sperm is like having raffle tickets;
8	the more you have, the more you win.
9 Semen is a very precious gift.
8	do not spill it on fake, vain things.

As we have priorly proved, semen is preciou, yet many men waste
it. Thank-God-fully, semen is a renewable resource. But, semen is
not free. For this elixir, our precious bodily fluids, are not
free. They require our nutrients. They require our hormones. They
require balls. Bu ultimately, they are renewable, and this is how
you replenish it (do this every time after you fail and, sadly,
nut):</P>

A direct correlation was seen in sperm number and overall of food intake.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Testosterone is required in large local concentrations to maintain the process, which is achieved via the binding of testosterone by androgen binding protein present in the seminiferous tubules.

Please do not laugh. Instead, acknowledge the empirical data
