What to Do After Relapsing
</H1>

<OL TYPE="I">
<LI>Ask God for forgivness
    Sing to God <A HREF="https://youtu.be/OVQ5hkuqwbo">
    Kyrie Eleison</A> in a
    deep voice. This is so
    you turn your heart
    back to God and incline
    your thoughts unto
    honoring Christ.
    2 Corinthians 10:5
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      Casting down
      imaginations, and
      every high thing that
      exalteth itself
      against the knowledge
      of God,
      and bringing into
      captivity every 
      thought to the
      obedience of Christ;
    </BLOCKQUOTE>

<LI>Exercise as a sign of
    forgiveness to God.
    Make no mistake, this
    is in no wise required
    for you to be forgiven.
    It is Christ who has
    bought us our
    forgiveness, out
    ourselves, for only He
    can. This is also to
    de-estimulate the mind
    and replenish some
    testosterone you have
    taken from the Temple
    of God. 1 Corinthians
    6:19
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      What? know ye not
      that your body is the
      temple of the Holy
      Ghost which is in
      you, which ye have of
      God, and ye are not
      your own?
    </BLOCKQUOTE>
</LI>
<LI>Take a cold shower to
     punish you, but also
     to make you feel
     better. You don't want
     to feel like trash,
     for then you'll be
     un-movitvated and do
     trashy things like
     watch junk and eat
     junk. We, as
     Christians, must
     glorify God in body
     and spirit. 1
     Corinthians 6:20
     <BLOCKQUOTE>
       For ye are bought
       with a price:
       therefore glorify
       God in your body,
       and in your spirit,
       which are God's.
