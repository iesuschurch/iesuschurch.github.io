I have blown 13 loads in the past 24 hours. I orgasm without semen, and I have watched about 40 porn videos. My testosterone levels are at 0.1. My penis is red and my balls ache. Everyone in my household is well aware of what I have been doing for the past 24 hours, my mother included. What do I do?</FONT></P>

<P>This turned out to be a larp. However, sadly, many people are
in such situations. Some people, during the 2020 lockdowns, went
down their lowest point. Many crumbled and fell to <A HREF="semenpoem.htm">
waste</A> their <A HREF="semenprecious.htm">semen</A>. They fell prey to
the mass amounts of pornography devered to them by Jews and women.

And who can blame them? The flesh is weak, and biologically
speaking, reproduction is our ultimate goal, wherefore it produces
the ultimate pleasure. The realiy is, we are being <STRONG>exploited.</STRONG>
Our strongest drives fundamental to the survival of species dating
back to the most primitive times (<A HREF="../evo/index.htm">Adam
and Eve</A>) are being exploited for profit at our, and humanity's,
sakes.</P><P>

However, we are not to only blame the Machine for
our grievances. We are also to take responsibility and resist it.
We are to fight it. If a bear chases after you, you do not start
to complain about how that isn't fair, for human's strength is
mental, not physical. No, you run for your life. That is what we
have to do here. <NOBR><FONT COLOR="red"><STRONG>Do <U>not</U> masturbate!</STRONG></FONT></NOBR>
