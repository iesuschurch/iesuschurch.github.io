Hello,  there.  I  see  you  decided to attend our
Bible  study.  Very well, welcome. I'm glad you're
joining us today. Take a seat.

So, today's Bible study is  on Matthew chapter 19.
This is an eventful  chapter wherein Jesus teaches
on many subjects, but we are going to be  focusing
on verses 10-12 with context some context from the
previous verses.

Matthew 19

[First, Jesus was teaching disciples and Pharisees
about the unlawfulness of divorce. Then, this hap-
pened:]

10. His disciples say unto him,  If the case  of
    the man be so with his wife,  it is not good
    to marry.
11. But  he said unto them,  All men cannot  re-
    ceive this saying,  save they to  whom it is
    given.
12. For  there are some eunuchs,  which were  so
    born from their mother's womb: and there are
    are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of
    of men:  and there  be eunuchs,  which  have
    made  themselves eunuchs for the kingdom  of
    heaven's  sake. He that  is able  to receive
    it, let him receive it.

Yes,  you heard that right. But, before I speak on
that, let us  go verse  by verse.  So, first Jesus
gives  out  a law that  the  disciples  considered
hard: no  divorce (except  it be  for fornication,
Matthew 19:9). Then the said that that is too hard
a law to keep. It is better they not marry at all.
Jesus then said  some men  make themselves eunuchs
for the Kingdom of Heaven's sake.

So,  in  those  two  examples we see a connection.
There is an identical theme: if you cannot  keep a
commandment,  if  keeping it is too  hard for you,
rid yourself of the possibility  to sin. Just as a
non-married man     ^^^^^^^^^^^  cannot    divorce
his  wife, a  eunuch  cannot  commit  fornication.
And  that is the lesson:  the best way to stopping
yourself from committing a sin is by freeing your-
self of the abilty to sin. The best way to not sin
is to preclude* it.

* to make impossible

Now,  as of the implications of the lesson itself,
it is not  the first time we hear something of the
sort. In Matthew 5:29-30 Jesus teaches

29. And  if thy right eye offend thee,  pluck it
    out, and cast it from  thee: for it is prof-
    itable  for  thee  that  one of thy  members
    should perish,  and not that  thy whole body
    should be cast into hell.
30. And if thy right  hand offend thee,  cut  if
    off, and cast it from thee:  for it is prof-
    itable for  thee  that  one of  thy  members
    should perish,  and  not that thy whole body
    should be cast into hell.

So,  what does Matthew 5:29-30  and  Matthew 19:12
have in  common in terms of the lesson?  They both
teach that it is better to remove a member of your
body  than to sin.  And indeed,  it is better that
one of your members  be cast into  Hell  than that
your  entire body be cast into Hell. However,  how
come, then, all Popes had both of their eyes?  How
come the disciples had both of their eyes? We know
not a of a  single disciple  without  a hand.  So,
then,  are  they not  tempted thereby?  Have  they
never sinned therefore?  The most likely answer is
no. So, then, did they sin in not following Jesus'
commandment of  not  cutting off one of their mem-
bers?  I do not believe so, for was such the case,
Jesus would surely have made such thing known unto
them. So, clearly there is more context we are not
taking into account here. And indeed there is.

We will not be cast into Hell for our sins. For we
cannot atone for our sins, not even by  righteous-
ness,  for all our righteousnesses  are as  filthy
rags (Isaiah 64:6).  So,  why then does  Jesus say
that?  It is because such  would  be necessary  in
order to stop sinning. Thus Jesus illustrates that
it is impossible to get into  Heaven without Mercy
from God.

Now, does that basically nullify Matthew 19:12 ex-
cept on a symbollical basis?  No!  For behold, al-
though  we may already  be saved by  Jesus Christ,
that does not mean we should sin all we want.  God
says  He  will chastise  us and that He will judge
us.  Jesus said those who break the smallest  com-
mandment  and shall teach  men so shall  -  not be
damned  -  but called the  least in the Kingdom of
Heaven.  So be wary not to sin.  Anyways,  but I'm
digressing. What I'm saying is don't do as Matthew
19:12 says thinking that's how you'll make it into
Heaven.  That won't get you into Heaven,  for only
Jesus Christ can.

Basically, to wrap things up, if your penis causes
you to sin,  cut it off,  for it is better for you
to lose one of your members than for you to sin.
