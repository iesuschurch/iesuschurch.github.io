<P>
Pornography is the forbidden fruit from the Garden of Eden.
For behold everything God has given us - the trees, the
mountains, the birds, the ocean, the smells, the food,
everything - and from all this we may delight. There is,
however, a fruit which we are not allowed to eat from. Do we
therefore ignore this fruit and instead go on to enjoy all the
gifts God has given us? No, we are sinners like our ancestors
Adam and Eve, and we go and bite from the fruit.
</P><P>

It is the same thing with the internet. There are thousands of
terabytes of <A HREF="../index.htm" TITLE="Home page">
delightful internet</A> full of <A HREF="https://dailystormer.in" TITLE="Daily Stormer" REL="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">
knowledge</A> and <A TITLE="The Bible" HREF="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/k/kjv/browse.html">
wisdom</A>, but there is the forbidden side, the side of lust
and evil. Do we go for the good or the evil? You, right now,
are on the good side, for you are edifying your mind, but
there are many who dwell on the evil side. It is those who
neglect all the other trees and animals God has given them and
instead go and bite from the forbidden fruit thus damning
themselves.
</P><P>

So, brethren, whenever ye are tempted to bite from the
forbidden fruit of pornography, look around at all the other
trees, and bite from those instead. Bite from the tree of
enjoying time with your family; that's a good one. Or bite
from the tree of going on your bicycle. Bite from the tree of
reading a book, or bite from the tree of listening to the
radio. These are all just ideas, but there is a whole garden
for you to explore. Just remember to stay clear from the Tree
of Knowledge of Good and Evil that you may not be tempted.
Stay on the other side of the Garden of Eden far away from
evil that you may not eat therefrom. Eat from all the other
trees and talk to God instead.</P>
