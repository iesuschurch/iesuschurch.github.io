Welcome to <A HREF="../index.htm">Iesus Church</A>. We gather
here today to talk about a very important issue: <A HREF="index.htm"
TARGET="_blank">pornogrpahy and masturbation</A>.

normalize pornography, an awful <A HREF="sin.htm">sin</A>
against the Lord, but do not be deceived.  Pornogrpahy is far
from normal and hotly close to sinful, for it <EM>is</EM>

sex <EM>within</EM> marriage</A>, and pornography is a big
insult to purity and chastity, Christian values which the Lord
esteems.</P><P>

However, I am not just here to talk about how pornogrpahy is a
sin as I have in many other <A HREF="index.htm">previous
articles</A>. I am here to further on the subject with the
Biblical truth that when you masturbate, you sin not only
against the L<SMALL>ORD</SMALL> (which is already bad enough),
you also sin against your own body which is of the Lord.

<LI>Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that <STRONG>commiteth fornication sinneth against his own body.</STRONG></LI>
<LI>What? know ye not that <STRONG>your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost</STRONG> which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?</LI>

Now, I would like to point out something interesting about the
verse above. It says that fornication is a sin against God and
against your body. But, wait a minute, how can fornication be
a sin against your body? Your body <EM>wants</EM> to reproduce,
and it is happy when one does so, hence the dopamine release
to reward us. So how can fornication be a sin against the body?

Behold, the Bible never directly mentions masturbation. Look
through the Bible and you will never find
